	Now FCP does a better job of remembering what fonts have been modified. In other words, fonts that not have been changed are now closed without the annoying warning of "saving the font Y/N?". (Thanks to Gwidon S. Naskrent). One more thing; because FCP isn't able to see wheather there's changed anything in a 'General' menu item, FCP assumes the font has been changed if one of those menu items has been selected.

	Also a lot of small changes and some internal restructuring has taken place.
	The 'testing a font' feature inside the Font Creator Program now supports printing.

	New Floating and dockable toolbars so now FCP has an even more professional interface.
	Added a checkbox that specifies whether the Font Creator Program should redraw the editing screen while moving contours and points.

	Fixed byte versus smallint bug. Some composite glyphs had an unexpected change of the x-offset -- Henry Kammler thanks for reporting this bug.
	Added color to the glyph captions. This option (like a lot of other options) can be changed through the "Edit->Options" menu item.
	Made the char grid navigable via arrow keys. The scrollbar lost focus. Gwidon S. Naskrent mentioned this bug and a lot of good tips.
	When a font has corrupted glyphs they won't show up, you'll see a red rectangle instead.

	Registration window, for registered users. At the moment it doesn't mean they get more features. But future versions will have some restrictions for unregistered users.

	Fixed a bug with the zoomin button.
	Fixed a bug with selecting multiple contours.
FontCreator 1.0.5 [January 25, 1999]
